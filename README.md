## How to add toolbar on arcgispro

[Quick Access Toolbar](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/quick-access-toolbar.htm)

> How to add a toolbox in ArcGIS pro.


To add a toolbox to your project, click Insert > Toolbox > Add Toolbox and browse to the toolbox, or right-click any toolbox in a folder connection and select Add To Project. 
A reference to the toolbox will be saved with your project in the Toolboxes node in the Catalog pane.

You can share add-ins easily because they do not require an additional installation program. 
You can add add-ins to your machine from a shared network location by double-clicking the file in Windows File Explorer or by manually copying the file to a well-known folder. 
Add-ins can also be shared by email or from a portal.

> Note :
Add-ins are developed with the ArcGIS Pro SDK 2.6 for the Microsoft .NET Framework. Visit the ArcGIS for Developers site to build your first add-in.

### Validate and copy an add-in

1. Before you install an add-in, it must be validated. Validation ensures that the file is copied to the appropriate location and that there are no name conflicts. It also guarantees that an existing version of the add-in is not overwritten by an older version.

2. Locate the add-in on your computer or shared network drive.
You may browse to its location using Windows File Explorer, open it from an email attachment, or download it from a portal.

3. Double-click the add-in.
The Esri ArcGIS Add-In Installation Utility opens.

4. On the Esri ArcGIS Add-In Installation Utility, review the author, description, version, and digital signature information of the add-in.
Click Install Add-In.
The add-in is validated and copied to a well-known folder for use in ArcGIS Pro.

### View add-ins

Once an add-in has been validated and installed, you can view it in the Add-In Manager and use it in ArcGIS Pro. To open the Add-In Manager options, follow these steps:

1. From an open project, click the Project tab on the ribbon. Alternatively, on the ArcGIS Pro start page, click Settings Settings in the lower left corner.

2. In the list on the left, click Add-In Manager.

3. When you open the Add-In Manager page, ArcGIS Pro searches specified well-known folders for add-in files. After the files are located, they are installed and appear on the Add-Ins tab of the Add-In Manager. The Add-Ins tab provides information about available add-ins.
